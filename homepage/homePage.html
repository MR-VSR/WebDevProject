            <p class="homeDescription">The heritage city of <span class="homeHighlight">Mysuru</span> is situated in the state of Karnataka in the
                Southern-India.
                Our perception of Mysore changed completely when we arrived here and joined <span class="homeHighlight">NIE</span>. Though Kannadigas are
                the main residents, yet people from all parts of India can be found here. Therefore, English would be an
                excellent medium to communicate and exchange your thoughts. An immensely diverse city with strong
                historical importance and a rich cultural heritage, Mysore has immensely beautiful palaces and scenic
                beauty of <span class="homeHighlight">Chamundi Hills</span> is soul-stirring.
                <br />

                The food here consists of proper South Indian food and deserts are delicious and fulfilling. In contrast
                to North-Indian cuisine, food here is less spicy and seems simple and sweet. The famous silk-sarees,
                Mysore paintings and rosewood work are specialties. The famous pan-Indian festival <span class="homeHighlight">Dussra</span> is
                celebrated here very auspiciously.
                <br/>
                Our excellent and hard-working team consists of 6 members, all belonging to neighboring states of UP,
                Bihar and Rajasthan. Though culturally Karnataka differs from these states in terms of food, clothing,
                spoken languages and dominant festivals yet what binds us together is the fact that we are Indians. And
                this is the beauty of India. 
                <br/>
                The motto of this project is to take you on a cultural journey of our
                native states to give you a sneak peek into the diversity of our beautiful country.
                UP and Bihar are religiously and mythologically very important with a huge number of temples. The beauty
                of different forts and palaces of different kings in Rajasthan is widely acknowledged. Languages in few
                of these states even vary every 20-30 kms. Rajasthan’s delicacies include Gatte ki sabzi, Bajre ki roti,
                namkeens and fulfilling ghevar. Lucknow’s famous kebabs and tikkas attracts an enormous number of people
                from everywhere. The jalebis and samosas are must have in UP. The famous Bihari Litti Chokha and
                Champaran meat’s worth is known everywhere. From the beautiful Taj Mahal to stunning Madhubani
                paintings, the ancient temples and monuments make UP and Bihar rich in culture. The folk music of
                Rajasthan and Katputli dance are soul-stirring.
